# Overview
Automatically installs a Nessus scanner and connects it to Tenable.io.  This is done using a powershell script to automate the installation of WinPcap and Nessus, and then run the commands to link Nessus to Tenable.io.

# Usage
This script requires the Nessus installer file and Winpcap 4.1.3 to be in the local directory.  Also update the script with your Tenable.io linking key.  You may also need to update with the name of the Nessus installer file and the window title that of the Nessus installer when it runs.
